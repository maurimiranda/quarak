# QUARAK SERVER

Quarak is a pretty simple shared expenses manager. It's very useful to manage expenses in shared offices or trips.

"Quarak" doesn't mean anything at all. Do not try to understand the name.

This project is only an API and has been implemented with Ruby on Rails.

There's also a [web client application](https://github.com/ricomambo/quarak-web) built using AngularJS.

Other clients, specially for mobile devices will be created soon.

Quarak is Free Software and you can get the code at [GitHub](https://github.com/ricomambo/quarak-server).
